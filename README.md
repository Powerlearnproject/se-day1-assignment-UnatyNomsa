Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
1. What is Software Engineering and Its Importance
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software is built efficiently, meets user needs, and is reliable and scalable.

Importance in the Technology Industry:

Enables development of complex systems (e.g., operating systems, enterprise software).

Reduces development time and cost through efficient processes.

Improves software quality and user satisfaction.

Supports innovation in areas like AI, healthcare, and finance.

2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-70s)
Introduction of structured programming principles helped manage complexity and improve code clarity (e.g., Dijkstra's work).

Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970)
Proposed by Winston Royce, it formalized a sequential approach to software development.

Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery.

3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis – Understanding user needs.

Design – Creating architecture and design plans.

Implementation (Coding) – Writing actual code.

Testing – Verifying the software meets requirements.

Deployment – Releasing the software to users.

Maintenance – Fixing bugs and updating the software over time.

4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Process	Sequential	Iterative
Flexibility	Low	High
Feedback	At the end	Continuous
Examples	Banking systems	Mobile app development
When to use Waterfall: When requirements are clear and unlikely to change (e.g., government contracts).
When to use Agile: When the project requires frequent updates or customer input (e.g., startups).

5. Team Roles and Responsibilities
Software Developer
Designs, writes, and maintains code; collaborates with other team members to build features.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Tests software to find bugs; ensures product meets quality standards.

Project Manager (PM)
Plans, organizes, and oversees the project timeline, resources, and communication between teams.

6. Importance of IDEs and VCS
Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
Provides tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one interface (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).

Version Control System (VCS):
Tracks code changes, supports collaboration, and enables rollback (e.g., Git, GitHub).

7. Common Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Managing changing requirements
Solution: Use Agile methods and involve stakeholders regularly.

Challenge: Debugging complex issues
Solution: Implement thorough testing and logging practices.

Challenge: Collaboration in distributed teams
Solution: Use tools like Slack, Jira, and Git for communication and tracking.

8. Types of Software Testing
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions.

Integration Testing: Ensures components work together.

System Testing: Tests the complete system as a whole.

Acceptance Testing: Confirms the system meets business requirements.

Importance: These tests help identify and fix errors early, ensuring software reliability and performance.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1. What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting effective input queries or instructions to guide AI models (like ChatGPT) toward accurate and relevant outputs. It’s essential for maximizing the usefulness of AI interactions.

2. Example of a Vague vs. Improved Prompt
Vague Prompt:
“Tell me about history.”

Improved Prompt:
“Summarize the causes and effects of World War II in under 150 words.”

Why the Improved Prompt Works Better:

Clarity: Specifies the exact topic.

Focus: Limits the scope to WWII.
